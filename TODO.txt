TO DO
- Come up with shop ideas (based on master list, maybe like 15) with actual item and services
  - Librarian with books to learn new languages
  - Blacksmith with weapon sharpening services
  - Cartographer with maps of the area that could reveal treasure or help with Survival checks moving through the area
  - etc.
- Re-work how all CSS and layout is done

KNOWN ISSUES
- Same haggle roll inputted twice in a roll doesn't work
- createShop.js will not copy last shop in CSV
- The ShopList does not update and will still show the last "highlighted" shop, even after the 'X' button is clicked.
