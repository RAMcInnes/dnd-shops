The Consortium’s leader, a mysterious figure known as the “Clockmaker,” is a master Tinkerer with a genius for crafting intricate and deadly machines.\n\tWhile in college, Inspiration studied with a woman who had an odd view of life and could possibly be the “Clockmaker.” He thinks the profile fits based on the rumors he’s heard. He pleads to the region’s military to take the rumors seriously and investigate. They sent several members to investigate, but they never returned.\n\tNow, they wish to fund Inspiration and whatever crew he wishes to hire to chase down the clues and stop what seems to be an impending crisis. They pledge an almost unlimited purse for supplies and pay for a team of specialists.",
