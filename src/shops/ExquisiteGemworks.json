	"description": "Exquisite Gemworks, a brightly painted stone building, is a jewelry shop protected by magical security. The shop, marked by a wooden sign shaped like a faceted gemstone, has a small customer-facing interior and a large back room filled with gem-cutting and jewelry-making equipment. The owner, <u>Lord Cecil Stoneforge</u>, is a former noble who loves every aspect of the gem business and handles the most delicate cutting tasks himself. His apprentice, <u>Helena Brightstone</u>, enjoys working with Cecil and takes on responsibilities such as performing rough cuts and faceting on less valuable gems, selecting finished gemstones for jewelry creation, and maintaining the shop’s appearance. She also records her daily activities, discoveries, and new techniques learned in a growing stack of journals.",
