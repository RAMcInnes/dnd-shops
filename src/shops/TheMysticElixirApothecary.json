After reading an odd note or passage about “The Alchemist’s Grove” for the seventh time, she finally asks Bo what it is. Bo explains that it is just a fairy tale about a place that contains every secret and ingredient an alchemist would need to learn the secrets of transmutation – not just lead to gold but anything, even death to life. He adds that many have lost their lives in the search for this nonexistent place, and he even hands her a personal notebook of all his notes, which he says proves conclusively that it is a fairy tale and invites her to borrow it. Three days later, she tells Bo her home was broken into and only the notebook was stolen.",
