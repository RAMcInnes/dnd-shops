	"description": "The Arcane Bond Bestiary, a stone building with a slate roof, is a pet shop with a colorful exterior mural and a dachshund-shaped sign. The interior, smelling of lemon and hay, is divided into sections for pets and familiars, with animals housed in pens, cages, and tanks. The shop offers a variety of animals, from common pets to exotic creatures for those seeking familiars. The owner, <u>Agathon Blackthorn</u>, is a middle-aged man with a rare skin condition that avoids sun exposure. He has a calming demeanor and is dedicated to helping customers find their perfect companion. His apprentice, <u>Kelsiie Fornath</u>, a widow with a love for animals, assists in the shop’s operations, including feeding the animals, maintaining cleanliness, and stocking shelves. She is learning the nuances of animal care and customer-animal matching under Agathon’s guidance.",
