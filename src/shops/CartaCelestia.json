The interior, illuminated by a skylight and oil lamps, houses a large drafting table where a bearded man works on a map. The owner, <u>Master Aurelius Serentius</u>, a distinguished figure with salt-and-pepper hair and piercing blue eyes, demonstrates a calm and measured demeanor, guiding customers and apprentices into the captivating realm of cartography. Apprentice <u>Eleanora Marlowe</u>, a young and vibrant woman, practices mapping techniques under Aurelius’s tutelage and often marks maps with stylized images of native flowers.",

Legend has it that this city exists on the other side of the known world, accessible only during a celestial alignment that occurs once in a century. It sits unloved because Serentius believes it to be a fake and of no value– but he will happily sell it to the visitor for an exorbitant price.",
