	"description": "The Ironclad Foundry, a medium-sized brick shop with a large outdoor workshop, is located on the town’s edge. The workshop, equipped with a forge, anvil, and various tools, is used to transform iron ingots into practical goods. The shop displays a variety of products, from bedframes to iron pots, and uses a wagon for deliveries. The neighborhood is filled with the sounds of forging and the smell of sulfur from the burning coal. The owner, <u>Ealdred Ironhand</u>, is a dedicated craftsman who takes pride in his work and considers his hammer a lucky charm. He enjoys creating custom designs and is grateful for his trade. Apprentice <u>Maxie Jerslain</u>, a young man with a farming background, is learning the craft under Ealdred’s guidance, starting with basic tasks like stoking the coal and making simple items, and gradually mastering more complex skills.",

He is willing to pay well and only cares about the anvil. Anything else the adventurers can recover is a bonus.",
