The owner, <u>Cedric Lorraine</u>, is an elderly man with a passion for cheese-making, often sharing his knowledge and the shopâ€™s history with customers. Despite his aging brain, he still handles many critical tasks in the cheese-making process. Apprentice <u>Matilda Warenne</u>, a young woman with a sense of wonder for the transformation from milk to cheese, is learning about all the cheeses and enjoys sharing her knowledge with customers. She is responsible for adding the correct measures of various types of milk to the vats, cutting and scooping out the curds, pressing the curds into molds, and coating the wheels in colored wax.",
