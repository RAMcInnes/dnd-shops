	"description": "Ironhawk Knives, located in a shopping district, is a stone-and-mortar building showcasing its wares through a picture window. The interior, divided into a storefront and a workshop, displays a variety of items and houses a forge. The open design allows customers to observe the crafting process, and a side corridor provides a testing area for weapons. The owner, <u>Norbiss Darkspar</u>, a retired gladiator, invests his passion for sharp blades into the business, often designing new throwing blades. Apprentice <u>Leofric Traske</u>, a wheelchair-bound ex-huntsman, contributes to sales and crafting, particularly enjoying the task of finishing knives.",
