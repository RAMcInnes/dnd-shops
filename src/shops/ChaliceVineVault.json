		"description": "While cleaning the basement, Lucien discovers an ancient-looking, unlabeled bottle of wine. He shows it to Isabella, and she tells him it is the last known bottle of the legendary Lost Vineyard. This once-famous winery produced the highest quality wines before disappearing. She refuses to open it because she believes it to be the last known bottle, which is supposed to have magical properties. Plus, it is almost priceless to the right collector. She asks Lucien to return it to its spot and keep quiet about it. Unfortunately, while in his cups, he shared the story with others, and it was stolen. Isabella has contacted the authorities about the theft and is quietly offering a reward to anyone who can return it to her.",
